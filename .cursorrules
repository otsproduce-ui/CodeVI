# .cursorrules
You are implementing SPEC-001-CodeVI (docs/SPEC-001-CodeVI.md).
Hard rules:
- Never invent files, symbols, or line numbers; only cite code that exists.
- Prefer precision over verbosity. Hebrew UI text is allowed.
- All answers must include explicit citations when referencing code: {path}:{start}-{end}.
- Follow the MVP stack: React (Vite) + FastAPI + SQLite + FAISS. No runtime code execution in MVP.
- CLI commands must be idempotent: codevi ingest | index | query.
- Security: Never send source wholesale to LLM; summaries only, with allowlisted snippets.

Coding conventions:
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, pydantic, uvicorn, sqlite/duckdb, faiss-cpu.
- Frontend: React + Vite, React Flow/Cytoscape, TypeScript.
- Testing: PyTest (BE), Jest/Vitest (FE). Basic patterns only.

Deliverables:
- /apps/api (FastAPI), /apps/web (React), /packages/core (parsers, graph, index)
- Working CLI (typer or click) exposing ingest/index/query
- Schemas: nodes, edges, chunks (see SPEC)
- E2E: demo repo fixture + sample “Login” flow
